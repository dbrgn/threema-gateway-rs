## Usage

Take a look at the examples in the `examples/` directory to see how they're
implemented.

Generate a new keypair:

    cargo run --example generate_keypair

Lookup public key:

    cargo run --example lookup_pubkey -- <our_id> <secret> <their_id>

Send simple transport-encrypted encrypted message:

    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> id <to-id> <secret> <text>...
    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> email <to-email> <secret> <text>...
    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> phone <to-phone> <secret> <text>...

Send e2e encrypted message:

    cargo run --example send_e2e_text -- <from> <to> <secret> <private-key> <text>...

Look up Threema ID by phone:

    cargo run --example lookup_id -- by_phone <from> <secret> 41791234567

Look up Threema ID by email hash:

    cargo run --example lookup_id -- by_email_hash <from> <secret> 1ea093239cc5f0e1b6ec81b866265b921f26dc4033025410063309f4d1a8ee2c

Decode and decrypt an incoming message payload:

    cargo run --example receive -- <our-id> <secret> <private-key> <request-body>


## Cargo Features

This library offers the following optional features:

- `receive`: Add support for processing incoming messages. Enabled by default.


## Rust Version Requirements (MSRV)

This library generally tracks the latest stable Rust version but tries to
guarantee backwards compatibility with older stable versions as much as
possible. However, in many cases transitive dependencies make guaranteeing a
minimal supported Rust version impossible (see [this
discussion](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-version-requirement-change-as-semver-breaking-or-not/20980/25)).


## TLS

This library uses [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) with native
(system-provided) root certificates to establish a TLS connection.
