This is a work-in-progress implementation of a Threema Gateway client library
in Rust.

Not everything is implemented yet, but sending simple and end-to-end encrypted
messages works.

This library requires Rust 1.18+.

## Usage

Take a look at the examples in the `examples/` directory to see how they're
implemented.

Lookup public key:

    cargo run --example lookup_pubkey -- <our_id> <secret> <their_id>

Send simple transport-encrypted encrypted message:

    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> id <to-id> <secret> <text>...
    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> email <to-email> <secret> <text>...
    cargo run --example send_simple -- <from> phone <to-phone> <secret> <text>...

Send e2e encrypted message:

    cargo run --example send_e2e_text -- <from> <to> <secret> <private-key> <text>...

Look up Threema ID by phone:

    cargo run --example lookup_id -- by_phone <from> <secret> 41791234567

Look up Threema ID by email hash:

    cargo run --example lookup_id -- by_email_hash <from> <secret> 1ea093239cc5f0e1b6ec81b866265b921f26dc4033025410063309f4d1a8ee2c
